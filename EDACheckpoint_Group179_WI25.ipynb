    "Education has long been recognized as a key factor in income levels, with a higher level of education generally perceived to increase earning potential. Prior research supports this, showing individuals tend to have higher earnings, “a college degree is key to economic opportunity, conferring substantially higher earnings on those with credentials than those without”.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) As access to education has increased, the expectation that higher levels of education can unlock better job opportunities and financial stability with it. A formal education is important, but further nuance and research is needed to examine this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies consistently showed that individuals with advanced education tend to have higher lifetime earnings. “The College Payout” explains “bachelor’s degree holders earn 31 percent more than workers with an associate’s degree and 74 percent more than those with just a high school diploma”.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This paper finds a positive relationship between educational attainment and median earnings. Similar ideas are communicated in a study done by the National Center for Education Statistics, as levels of education increased, median earnings followed similarly.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) “The pattern of those with educational attainment having higher median earnings held, in general, for both male and female 25- to 34-year-olds who worked full time, year-round in 2022.” \n",
    "\n",
    "There is other previous work done to show the effects of having a degree in general, regardless of which level.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) The study concludes through its research that “\\[c\\]ollege graduates are half as likely to be unemployed as their peers whose highest degree is a high school diploma.” This goes to show the struggles of even finding a job for someone without a degree. Then there is the income factor, which is also devastating. To prove this with their numbers, they deduced that a person with a bachelors will on average make a whopping 86% higher than people who just have a high school diploma. The difference between having a degree and not having one is evident and clear. Additionally, the research proved that at “median lifetime earnings are $1.2 million higher for bachelor’s degree holders”.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) It can be concluded that people who have a degree under their belts will almost always have a higher income and job stability than those who don’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between education and salary can vary depending on the type of education pursued. Vocational education can also potentially lead to immediate employment opportunities but may not provide the same long-term income growth as academic degrees. This may be due to more specific professional training in post-secondary education with an emphasis on occupational hierarchy. There are a variety of high paying trade jobs including, but not limited to, HVAC technicians, electricians, and plumbers that offer high paying salaries without needing a four-year degree or above. Not all forms of education have the same income trajectory. There are many ways to achieve a great deal of financial success that should be mentioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we look to similarly examine the relationship between post-secondary education and annual earnings, particularly focusing on whether individuals with such education are more likely to earn above or below $50,000 per year.\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that there will be a trend of an increased likelihood of $50k or more salary alongside an individual’s level of education, with perhaps a small departure from the trend when comparing the salaries of young individuals with a vocational associate's degree to those with higher levels of education.  We predict this overall trend because of our research and prior knowledge that suggest higher education on average results in more successful careers and salaries and that four-plus year degrees provide specialized knowledge and opportunities for career advancement when compared to an associate degree or lesser college experience.  We predict an exception to the trend with vocational associates because we believe vocational training may provide high initial wages in technical fields but constraints in long-term salary growth which could surface in our analysis.\n"

    "Dataset Name: Salary Prediction Classification\n",

    "[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayessa/salary-prediction-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayessa/salary-prediction-classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ideal dataset would include recent demographic and employment data collected from sources such as the U.S. Census or alumni surveys from several colleges and high schools. It would contain several thousand observations to ensure a representative sample across different education levels. The annual/hourly income data would be categorized into granular brackets (5-10k), while each row in the dataset would represent background information such as demographics, level of education, employment history, work experience, occupation, etc. This data could be cleaned of unique identifying information and properly anonymized, then stored in a relational database where each row would be a person’s set of answers and the columns would encompass each data field. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using, “Salary Prediction Classification”, was extracted from the 1994 U.S. Census database and consists of 32,600 observations. Each row represents an individual respondent, with columns including demographics, level of education, working hours per week, and a true/false value for whether the person’s salary is greater than $50K/year. The main objective of this analysis is to examine how educational level and work experience influence income levels. Although the dataset is somewhat outdated and does not reflect more recent economic trends, all data was recorded within the same historical and economic context, keeping the dataset consistent. Therefore, we can still make an accurate analysis of how educational level influenced income at that time without external factors such as inflation, job market conditions, or technological advancements. \n",
    "\n",
    "A critical part of this study is understanding how education levels impact salary, specifically for individuals working 40 hours per week, which means we would have to filter the dataset to include only ~40 hours/week workers for consistency. The dataset’s education level variable (numerical) categorizes individuals based on their highest degree attained, such as high school diploma, associate degree, bachelor’s degree, and so forth. Because education is one of the significant factors that influence earning potential, this will serve as a key variable in our analysis. Also, the dataset includes hours worked per week (numerical) that helps differentiate between part-time and full-time employment. Salary comparisons across education levels are most meaningful when controlling for work hours; therefore, this study will most likely focus specifically on full-time workers. \n",
    "\n", 
    "Another important variable to consider is salary, which is represented by a true/false value that indicates whether an individual earns above or below $50K/year. Although a more granular salary breakdown would allow for a more precise analysis, this classification can still produce relevant comparisons of salary distributions across different levels of education. The numerical age variable will also be useful when determining the age groups where post-secondary education provides more financial benefits. Furthermore, categorical variables like work class and occupation can provide additional context on how salaries differ across industries and employment types. They may serve as control variables to isolate the impact of education on salary outcomes. Since work classes vary between the private-sector, the public-sector, and the self-employed workers, patterns in wage disparities can be revealed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the census data is quite old, it is not irrelevant as all the salaries we analyze will be from the same time period and should reflect the impact of education level on annual salary. In 1994, a $50K annual salary for a 40 hours/week worker converts to an hourly wage of $24.04, which fell within the medium wage bracket at the time. Based on historical wage growth data, wages increased at an average rate of 0.1% per year between 1979 and 2019, which was followed by a sharp increase during the pandemic years. The total median wage growth from 1979 to 2023 estimates to be 17.4%, with an approximate 1.4% increase between 1979 and 1994 [4]. In today’s terms, this means that the threshold for the equivalent salary in a modern census data study should be around or more than $58K per year. \n",

   "source": [
    "The 1994 U.S. Census dataset is publicly sourced data collected and mandated by the U.S. government, which guarantees ethicality in its data collection. However, ethical and other critical challenges need to be addressed while interpreting older data. The challenges include representation biases, the limitations of outdated economic data, and the risk of perpetuating harmful stereotypes. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest concerns is representation bias because the dataset may not entirely represent the diversity of the U.S. population. Even though the 1994 Census covers a broad sample of the U.S. population, it may underrepresent various groups in certain ways. For example, the dataset can illustrate historical gender disparities, where women have historically earned lower wages than men for equivalent work and education levels. This inequality should be interpreted as a fundamental issue rather than an inherent relationship between gender and income. Likewise, racial and ethnic inequities are evident in the data, since certain barriers historically induced limited access to education and career opportunities for minority groups. Furthermore, because the dataset displays income at a single point in time, it does not reflect long-term potential or career advancement of individuals with different levels of education. In order to address these biases, this study’s findings will be set within their historical context while recognizing that the observed trends may not fully align with the present day. Also, any conclusions regarding income disparities will be cautiously made to avoid overgeneralization or predetermined claims that fail to consider broader influences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is the outdated nature of the dataset. Since 1994, the U.S. economy experienced drastic shifts that altered the relationship between education and income. Changes such as technological advancements, the decline of manufacturing jobs, and the rise of remote work clearly redefined labor market opportunities, which affects how education is associated with earnings. In addition, the increased tuition costs and student loan debt also change the economic relationship on higher education, while policy shifts like minimum wage changes and labor protections have influenced income distribution. To mitigate this limitation, our findings may be strictly framed as historical trends rather than comparisons to present-day labor market conditions. If applicable, we can discuss relevant policy changes and shifts in educational accessibility to provide additional context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the study should avoid implying harmful stereotypes when analyzing the relationship between education and income. The assumption that education alone determines earnings would fail to notice systemic factors such as historical discrimination, labor market inequality, and other barriers. Without careful analysis, our findings could unintentionally prompt insinuations that blame individuals for income disparities rather than recognizing structural conditions that shape economic outcomes. To prevent this, we will avoid claims that oversimplify the relationship between education and income, and instead emphasize the broader economic and policy frameworks that influence wage distributions.
